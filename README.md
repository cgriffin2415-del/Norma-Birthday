# Norma's 80th Birthday Invitation

This is a beautiful, interactive digital invitation for Norma's 80th Birthday Celebration.

## 📂 Project Structure
To deploy this website correctly, you must upload the following files and folders:

- **`index.html`**: The main invitation page with the photo carousel, details, and RSVP form.
- **`assets/`**: This folder is **REQUIRED**. It contains:
  - All the photos for the carousel.
  - The background music file (`music.mp3`).
  - Background images (`invitation-bg.jpg`, etc.).

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions (GitHub Pages)

1.  **Create a New Repository** on GitHub.
2.  **Upload Files**:
    - Upload `index.html`.
    - **Crucial**: Ensure you upload the entire `assets` folder. If dragging and dropping, drag the folder itself so it keeps the name "assets".
3.  **Go to Settings**:
    - In your repository, go to **Settings** > **Pages**.
    - Under **Branch**, select `main` (or `master`) and save.
4.  **Visit Your Site**: GitHub will give you a link (e.g., `yourusername.github.io/repository-name`).

## ✨ Features
- **Photo Carousel**: Auto-playing sliding gallery of memories.
- **Background Music**: Auto-plays user-selected music.
- **RSVP Form**: Integrated with Zapier for seamless guest list management in Google Sheets.
- **Responsive Design**: Looks great on mobile and desktop.
